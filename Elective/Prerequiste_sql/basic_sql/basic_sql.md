<br />  I think it is an important distinction to say that SQL is a language. Hence, the last word of SQL being language. SQL is used all over the place beyond the databases we will utilize in this class. With that being said, SQL is most popular for its interaction with databases.<br />
 
  
### Why Do Data Analysts Use SQL?
- SQL is easy to understand.
- Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
- Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
- SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
- SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.
  
  
### SQL vs. NoSQL
  You may have heard of NoSQL, which stands for not only SQL. Databases using NoSQL allow for you to write code that interacts with the data a bit differently than what we will do in this course. These NoSQL environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets the way we have been analyzing data up to this point. One of the most popular NoSQL languages is called MongoDB. <br />
  
### Why Do Businesses Choose SQL?
  #### Why Businesses Like Databases
  - Data integrity is ensured
  - Data can be accessed quickly
  - Data is easily shared 
  
  
A few key points about data stored in SQL databases:
  - Data in databases is stored in tables that can be thought of just like Excel spreadsheets.
  - All the data in the same column must match in terms of data type.
  - Consistent column types are one of the main reasons working with databases is fast.
  
Some of the most popular databases include:

  - MySQL
  - Access
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Postgres
  
 
## SQL 
  The key to SQL is understanding statements. A few statements include:

- CREATE TABLE is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
- DROP TABLE is a statement that removes a table in a database.
- SELECT allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query.
The SELECT statement is the common statement used by analysts<br />
