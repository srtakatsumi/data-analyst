# Lesson Overview

- NumPy - uses data structures called arrays which make working with numerical data super simple and fast
- Pandas - uses data structures called data frames to manipulate and analyze data
- Matplotlib - allows you to quickly build visualizations from the data
___
- Exploring data through a process of inquiry
- Analyzing and visualizing data using numerical statistics and plotting
- Evaluating data to clearly and effectively communicate your findings.

## The Data Analysis Process

1 - Question; <br />
2 - Wrangle; <br />
3 - Explore; <br />
4 - Draw Conclusions;<br />
5 - Communicate.<br />

## Wrangling e EDA (exploratory data analysis)

are sometimes used synonymously because their purposes often overlap. <br />

- EDA	= exploring and augmenting data to maximize the potential of analysis, visualizations, and models; for example, engineering new features and removing outliers.<br />

- Wrangling =	gathering, assessing, and cleaning data<br />
<br />
<br />
Data acquisition can happen in a number of ways:<br />

- Downloading files that are readily available<br />
- Getting data from an API or web scrapping<br />
- Pulling data from existing databases<br />
- There may also be a need to combine data from multiple different formats.<br />
<br />
CSV (comma separated values)	= is a text file with a tabular structure that holds only raw data. It is easy to process manually using code such as python.<br />
